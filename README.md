#Advantages of GitHub Actions over Self-Hosted Runners

Hosting: GitHub Actions uses GitHub-managed cloud runners with no setup or maintenance required. Self-hosted runners require you to configure and maintain your own machines.

User interface: GitHub Actions works fully inside GitHub with an easy setup. Self-hosted runners need installation, machine configuration, and ongoing updates.

Cost: GitHub Actions offers free minutes for public repos and predictable pricing for private ones. Self-hosted runners require you to pay for hardware and maintenance.

#Advantages of Self-Hosted Runners over GitHub Actions

Customization: Self-hosted runners provide full control over the environment, letting you install custom tools and dependencies not available in GitHub-hosted runners.

Performance: You can use more powerful or specialized hardware to speed up builds and tests.

Environment access: Self-hosted runners can securely access internal networks, private systems, and on-prem resources that GitHub-hosted runners cannot reach.

###In conclusion, GitHub Actions is ideal for easy use and zero maintenance, while self-hosted runners offer customization, control, and access to private infrastructure.
